The nowdays more popular PNAs have a bit limited ability on select and start the navigation software. 
The majoriy of these equipments are produced by the Chinese Yuan Feng LTD, thus their firmware is
very similar. Unfortunately the software of the device is only designed for starting fast and simple only
one navigation program.


The devices I have (BluePanther Diamond and Wayteq x820) use almost the same logic
when the user starts the navigation program:


On x820 it is possible to set the path of the navigation application using the settings page. If there is 
anything set here, it has absolute priority.


If there no navigation application path has been set (or the device - e.g. BP Diamond - does not support
this feature) The application starts described in shell.ini in the internal flash memory
(\ResidentFlash) If \ResidentFlash\shell.ini does not exist, it will try the same with shell.ini in
the root directory of the SD card (\SDMMC\shell.ini) and starts the program there. 
If none of the above files exists it tries to start
\SDMMC\MobileNavigator\MobileNavigator.exe, then if this does not exists it tries
\ResidentFlash\MobileNavigator\MobileNavigator.exe


However we have several way to select which navigation software to start, we have to wander through the
setup menu - even with the Waytew x820/x620 which has the las updated software - if we would like to start
 a different application than before or have
to edit a file or rename some direcories if the application selector feature is missing (BP Diamond/Zafire)
